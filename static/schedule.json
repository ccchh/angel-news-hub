                        "abstract": "&quot;A year ago in November 2012, Nintendo released their latest home video game console: the Wii U. While most video game consoles use controllers that are very basic, the Wii U took the opposite route with a very featureful gamepad: wireless with a fairly high range, touch screen, speakers, accelerometer, video camera, and even NFC are supported by the Wii U gamepad. However, as of today, this interesting piece of hardware can only be used in conjunction with a Wii U: wireless communications are encrypted and obfuscated, and there is no documentation about the protocols used for data exchange between the console and its controller. Around december 2012, I started working with two other hackers in order to reverse engineer, document and implement the Wii U gamepad communication protocols on a PC. This talk will present our findings and show the current state of our reverse engineering efforts.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;When the Wii U was released, a few console hackers and I were talking about potential uses for the Wii U gamepad. However, before being able to use a Wii U gamepad as a remote controller for a robot or a quadricopter, the first step was to understand how it worked and how to communicate with it. This started our long journey of soldering wires on Flash chips, reading the h.264 specification and complaining about the lack of features in most Wi-Fi drivers and devices (on all platforms, Linux and ath9k devices being the least horrible).\r\n\r\nWhile some “journalists” reported that the Wii U gamepad is using the Miracast™ technology, a Wi-Fi standard, it turned out that this was never the case. Instead, Nintendo decided to reinvent four different protocols (video streaming, audio streaming, input streaming as well as a light request-reply RPC protocol), and embed them in a slightly obfuscated version of WPA2, sent over the air using 5GHz Wi-Fi 802.11n. A small ARM CPU is embedded in the Wii U Gamepad (codenamed DRC) and runs a realtime operating system to handle network communication. In the Wii U, another ARM CPU (codenamed DRH) does the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will go into the details of how we went from a 32MB binary blob to a proof of concept of Wii U gamepad “emulation” on a PC, including full documentation of the wireless communications obfuscation layer and partial documentation of the four data exchange protocols used on the gamepad.&quot;",

                        "abstract": "&quot;Die Enthüllungen Edward Snowdens haben die deutsche Politik für kurze Zeit in Aufregung gebracht. Für eine Beruhigung reichte es bereits aus, die Enthüllungen in sprachlich-logisch cleverer Weise zu verarbeiten, sie teilweise in ein anderen Kontext zu stellen und so schließlich Entwarnung geben zu können: Die Bundesregierung hat „keine Anhaltspunkte für flächendeckende Überwachung“.\r\n\r\nBei diesem Vorgehen handelt sich um ein Paradebeispiel dafür, wie mit einfachen sprachlich-rhetorischen Tricks die politisch Verantwortlichen die Öffentlichkeit und sich selbst so weit täuschten, dass es ihnen nicht mehr nötig erschien, sich mit den eigentlichen Problemen auseinanderzusetzen, und so das leidige Thema aus dem Wahlkampf herausgehalten werden konnte. Neben den mittlerweile zum Standard gehörenden „Basta“-Floskeln spielte das Phänomen der Modalisierung eine besondere Rolle, wie die genauere Analyse zeigt. Auch logische Fehler wie Zirkelschlüssel und (zu) strikte Einschränkung des thematischen Bezugs erlaubten diese „Flucht-nach-vorne“-Strategie. Die Häufung sprachlicher Tricks und des logisch-inhaltlichen Ausweichens legen eine Inszenierung nahe.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;Die im Bundestag vertretenen Parteien äußerten sich alle zu den Snowden-Enthüllungen. Erwartungsgemäß griff die Opposition die Regierung scharf an, während die Regierung sehr schnell dabei war abzuwiegeln – zunächst eher ungeschickt. Dann trat eine überraschende Wende ein: Plötzlich waren sich alle einig, dass die NSA-Affäre vorbei sei. Selbst die Opposition beruhigte sich, die zunächst davon gesprochen hatte, Merkel habe ihren Amtseid gebrochen. Interessant ist, dass die Wende vor allem sprachlich vollzogen wurde, wie sich an den Äußerungen sehr schön zeigen lässt. Vor allem die Verwendung auffälliger Adverbien, von Zirkelschlüssen und die teilweise drastische Einschränkung der Bezüge sind entlarvend. Zu Wort kommen neben Angela Merkel, Ronald Pofalla, Thomas Oppermann und andere Protagonisten dieser besonderen Art von Imagepolitik.&quot;",

We will discuss — and release — tools to measure whether these changes are effective.\r\n\r\nSIM cards were identified as a remote exploitation risk this year: Unnoticed by the victim, an attacker can take control over a card by sending a few binary SMS. Network operators started filtering binary SMS and patched some of their weak SIM card configurations in response to vulnerability research. The talk looks at filtering evasion techniques and discloses new configuration vulnerabilities present in many cards world-wide.&quot;",

                        "description": "&quot;&lt;p&gt;The hacker community has a lot of words for situations in which access to the wrong part of memory leads to an exploitable vulnerability: buffer overflow, integer overflows, stack smashing, heap overflow, use-after-free, double free and so on. Different words are used because the techniques to trigger the faulty memory access and to subsequently use that to gain code execution vary, but they all share a common root cause: violation of spatial and temporal memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If one looks at the C/C++ standard, the situations that tend to be exploitable are 'unspecified'. Usually, compiler writers take that as an excuse to cut corners, to gain that extra bit of performance in the benchmarks. Because, you know, who cares you&#x27;re exploitable when you make a mistake, look how fast it is!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, the standards also allow the compiler to introduce safety checks, to see whether access to a pointer actually touches the inside of an allocated object instead of the outside (spatial memory safety), and to make sure that the pointer being accessed actually points to an object that has been allocated, but not yet been freed again (temporal memory safety). Such compilers do exist, in the form of LLVM with specialized optimizer passes that introduce runtime safety checks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This talk will look into the details of the implementation, the performance impact, practical handling, and of course, whether it really delivers the promised 100% protection against buffer overflows.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;",

This terrain determines our world, even as we\r\ndeal with our more individual relationships with authority, the ethics\r\nimposed by our positions in the world, and the psychological impact of learning that our paranoia was real.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the Internet and the politics it brings with it have changed the world, but that change is neither unopposed nor detatched from larger currents. From the battles over global surveillance and the culture of government secrecy to the Arab Spring and the winter of its discontent, these things are part of this moment&#x27;s tapestry and they tell us about the futures we can choose. The world is on fire, and there is nowhere to hide and no way to stay neutral.&quot;",

                        "description": "&quot;In the dark ages of digital cryptography, when ciphers were considered export-controlled munitions and AES was not yet standardized, the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, short BSI) decided to invent their own ciphers: CHIASMUS for software implementations and LIBELLE, which would be kept secret and only implemented in hardware.\r\n\r\nCHIASMUS is not publicly documented. It is implemented in a software tool of the same name, released by the BSI, which is only available where there is a public interest for its use. However, the GSTOOL, a database application for security audit management also released by the BSI, contains an encryption feature using the CHIASMUS block cipher, and is freely available. This software was developed by a third party, Steria Mummert Consulting, and apparently was not properly reviewed.\r\n\r\nWe disassembled and analyzed the GSTOOL to obtain the specification for the encrypted files (and thus the CHIASMUS cipher itself), but we got more than we bargained for. While the cipher itself appears to be pretty secure, the implementation is a collection of rookie mistakes and a great example of what can (and will) go wrong if you ask people with little understanding of cryptography to build cryptographic software and don&#x27;t verify their results.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to enjoy this thriller full of historic backgrounds, non-public public announcements, legal threats, weapons-grade stupidity, and a very simple solution for complex crypotographic problems. Facepalm with us on the two-year long hunt for the elusive security patch! Have a look at the (not-so-secret-anymore) CHIASMUS block cipher! Learn why you should not build your own crypto tools unless you really know what you are doing, even if you use a known algorithm. And what happens when government contractors attempt to do so. And then attempt to fix it.\r\n\r\n(Note: Since this is an implementation issue, the stand-alone Chiasmus software tool is not affected by this issue.)&quot;",

The first public demonstration of an ATM hack was given in 2010 - but how bad is this threat really? It turns out there is a multi-million dollar business behind ATM hacks. This talk reveals how these criminal gangs operate by disclosing information obtained through forensic analysis of a real compromise.\r\n\r\nIn the analyzed case some malware was used to control the hacked machine that was written specifically for the targeted ATM brand. By reverse-engineering this malware, we gained unique insights into the technologies used by the intruders. The malicious features range from balance monitoring over cash-out commands to the wiping of the machine to cover up traces of the attack. They can be accessed through special number codes that are entered directly via the machine&#x27;s number pad. Hooking techniques and overlay windows are used to display the status of the system on the ATM monitor.\r\n\r\nWe will further discuss that operations of this scale can only be performed by professional crime groups that not only have the technical capabilities to develop such special malware, but also have access to insider information about the design of ATMs and who know how the targeted banks operate.&quot;",

The idea is to bundle broadcast media content with online content which can be retrieved by the TV set through an Internet connection.\r\n\r\nMechanisms that allow the online content to be accessed by the TV set can be attacked and might put the TV user’s privacy at stake. The presentation highlights possible attack vectors of HbbTV-capable TV sets and introduces possible mitigations.&quot;",

Starting as a Pan-European effort, the HbbTV consortium wants to create a globally adopted standard for hybrid entertainment services. Especially within the so-called Declarative Application Environment (DAE) – the HbbTV browser – another standard for connected TVs is being adopted: The Open IPTV Forum standard for Internet protocol TVs (IPTV). This standard seems to cover the device-specific part for Internet functionality.\r\n\r\nThis new standard in the entertainment industry is currently rolled out in an increasing number of countries in- and outside of Europe. Besides concerns about privacy, this technology also raises concerns about security. Possible attack vectors and possible mitigations are introduced in this presentation.\r\n &quot;",

The most poisonous food imaginable is, of course, the forbidden fruit of the 'Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.' The ongoing catastrophic and bloody conflict between wisdom and knowledge has decimated humanity and many of its intellectual and cultural treasures. As a project in art and science, an international consortium has been organized to sequence the genome of Malus sieversii, a wlid apple from central Asia recently shown to be the ancestor of all domestic cultivars. A project to modify the Malus sieversii genome with a compressed version of Wikipdia is now underway.

Instead of using concrete data values SE uses symbolic values to evaluate a large set of parallel program paths at once. A drawback of many systems is that they need source code access and only scale to few lines of code. This talk explains how SE and binary analysis can be used to (i) reverse-engineer components of binary only applications and (ii) construct specific concrete input that triggers a given condition deep inside the application (think of defining an error condition and the SE engine constructs the input to the application that triggers the error).&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;Analysis and reverse engineering of binary programs is cumbersome. Consider the problem that we have a given interesting (error) condition inside the program that we want to trigger. How can we generate a specific input to the program that, during the execution of the program, will trigger the condition. In this talk we use a combination of binary analysis techniques that recover high-level control-flow and data-flow information from a binary-only application and Symbolic Execution (SE) to automate the analysis of such problems. Existing SE tools have often been used to achieve high coverage across all code paths in an application to find implementation bugs. We use SE for a different purpose; given a vulnerability condition hidden deep inside the application what is the input that triggers that condition.\r\n\r\nWe tackle the given problem in three major steps: (i) gathering information about the binary, (ii) analyzing the information-flow and control-flow of the binary, and (iii) using symbolic execution to generate a specific input example that triggers the specified condition. During the information gathering process we define the interesting condition and use regular analysis techniques to set-up later stages. In the information-flow and control-flow analysis we use a given sample input to collect a complete execution trace of the application that is then parsed into a graph that dissects the computation of the application into individual components. The last steps uses fuzzBall, our open-source SE engine to compute specific vulnerability-triggering inputs for the identified components.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate our technique we will show several examples using real programs, showing how we can use specific vulnerability conditions to automatically generate input that triggers this condition. In addition, we will show how our SE engine can be used for other interesting analysis on binary only applications. Our tools are available as open-source and we invite other hackers to join in on this project.&quot;",

                        "abstract": "&quot;This talk considers the use of new technology to police large crowds in the Romantic period. We examine ethical aspects of modern surveillance technologies by looking at debates around crowd control and face recognition in the age that first imagined, and reflected on, the surveillance state.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;1819 saw a craze in Britain for German mechanic Karl Von Drais’s Laufmaschine – a two-wheeled, peddleless wooden precursor of the bicycle dubbed “velocipede” or “dandy charger”. As well as recreational uses, military and police applications were quickly proposed for this futuristic technology. On 1 September 1819, The Tickler magazine imagined squadrons of “Dandy Dragoons” being used to police “public spectacles”. There was a serious point beneath the humour. Just two weeks earlier, brutal policing by soliders on horseback led to the deaths of protestors at a public meeting that became known as the Peterloo Massacre. We consider the Drais-maschine as a “hacked horse”, but one that caused public anxiety as well as fashionable interest. We consider Romantic debates around the proposed use of velocipedes for “home service”, since they strikingly anticipate contemporary discussions about drone deployment in homeland security contexts. We ask what light these early debates throw on our own misgivings about the “teching-up” of surveillance agencies.\r\n\r\nWe look at two “public spectacles” in the Romantic period. The first is the “Triumphant Entry into London” on 13 September 1819 of popular radical politician Henry Hunt to answer treason charges following his participation at Peterloo. The poet John Keats was among the 30,000-strong crowd who lined the streets to welcome him, and from his letters we have an eyewitness account. The second – related – “public spectacle” is imagined in a painting entitled “Christ’s Triumphant Entry into Jerusalem” by Keats’s friend B. R. Haydon. Haydon included Keats’s face in the crowd, as well as those of other poets and philosophers, including Voltaire and Newton. Critics of the painting referred to the “gross anachronism” of their presence – in another sense, though, they are merely in the wrong place, at the wrong time (Zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort). Both spectacles offer a bridge to a consideration of ethical aspects to C21 surveillance technology.\r\n\r\nThe final part of our talk focuses on Romanticism’s understanding of the interpretive role of face recognition. Modern software promises to turn facial features into objective, mathematical space, though arguably fails to move beyond the subjective heuristic space into which viewers of Haydon’s canvas were invited two hundred years ago. Modern face-tracking software’s act of recognition is always an act of imagining the subject’s relation to wrong-doing. The identified face in the crowd summons his or her “unenrolled” Doppelgänger, where individuals occupy a quantum-like state of uncertainty until a measurement is made against a crime – a problem to which Haydon’s painting seems supremely attuned.\r\n\r\nThe talk as a whole builds on our previous exploration at 29C3 of ways in which post-Enlightenment art, poetry and political philosophy is relevant to C21 discussions about surveillance culture.\r\n\r\n°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°\r\nProfessor Richard Marggraf Turley is Professor of Engagement with the Public Imagination at Aberystwyth University.

The system allows for 'strong signal capture' as well as, simply, signal modeling with 'strong signal alerting'. Also discussed will be using the array versus USRPs and the issue of antennae for all of the devices. I will explain the mistakes I made in building the array and what I did to attempt toovercome such pitfalls. The code for running the array will be introduced and released for public consumption. In addition, while we target the RTL-SDR devices, we will discuss the feasibility of including non-traditional SDR hardware in the array, including non-Realtek tuner cards and inclusion of HackRF devices.&quot;",

We discuss which sensing modalities can be used for digital and offline reading recognition, as well as how to combine them dynamically.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;People increasingly track their physical fitness, from step counting over recording sports exercises to monitoring their food intake (e.g. Fitbit, Runkeeper, LooseIt). People are more aware of their routine, let’s them improve their physical life, fostering better eating and exercise habits, decreasing the risk for any obesity related diseases, increasing the quality of life.  Physical activity recognition is becoming mainstream. \r\n\r\nTraditionally, research in activity recognition has focused on identifying physical tasks performed by the user through setting up elaborate, dedicated sensors in the lab. Yet, in recent years, physical activity recognition has become more mainstream. As industry begins to apply advances suggested by activity recognition research, we see more and more commercial products that help people track their physical fitness, from simple step counting (e.g., Fitbit One, Misfit Shine, Nike Fuelband, Withings Pulse) over sports expertise tracking (e.g. Runkeeper, Strava) to sleep monitoring.\r\nWe see also the first smartphone applications giving users an overview about their activities, for example “Human” and “Move”, just to name two. Their tracking abilities are still limited by the battery power of today’s smart phones. Yet, with the just announced M7 Chip in the new iPhone 5s (making it easy to aggregate and interpret sensor data in a power efficient manner), we can expect physical activity tracking will be sooner or later integrated in our smart phones and other everyday appliances.\r\n\r\nWhile people explored the problem of physical activity recognition thoroughly, the ability to detect cognitive activities is an area with many challenges. This exciting new research field, Cognitive Quantified Self, opens up new opportunities at the intersection of wearable computing, machine learning, psychology, and cognitive science. In this talk I  focus on tracking reading (the cognitive process of decoding letters, words, and sentences) in a mobile setting using optical eye tracking and occasionally first person vision (a camera worn on the users head).\r\n\r\nWe want to establish long-term tracking of many mental processes suggesting strategies to optimize mental fitness and cognitive well-being.\r\n\r\nImagine, educators can get real-time feedback about the attention level and learning progress of their students, giving them a good grasp on already understood and potential difficult concepts. Learning material can be redesigned and tailored towards the needs of the individual student, given their reading/learning history, their preferences and life-style.\r\n\r\nContent creators can use the quantified mind logs as a basis for improving their works. In which part of the movie are users most attentive? What feelings are conveyed by a particular paragraph in a book convey? In case you are a researcher, wouldn’t you like to know at what sentence a reader looses interest in your grant proposal?\r\n\r\nAnd we finally can tackle more difficult to analyze lifestyle issues, given a large enough user group and good enough sensing. e.g. How do sleep and eating habits influence our attention and learning?\r\n&quot;",

Usually these would be easy to ignore as these implications used to result in small fines for public disturbance, copyright infringement, and your average threatening lawyer&#x27;s letter. By now, anti-terrorist laws disable us to think freely about projects and issues that touch state authority and terrorism, because thinking terror already consitutes a crime. Hence we changed our strategy and went into the underground with 'illegal art', we have decided to publish such projects anonymously and internally we call them our 'Secret Projects'. We can never be connected to what we artistically do in the underground. But i will present the changing social habitat and legal circumstances affecting the production process for artists by showcasing some of our key UBERMORGEN projects and revealing as little as possible about our 'Secret Projects'. \r\n\r\nIn my talk i need to call to attention the many cases of self-censorship that every user on the net takes part in, the immensly negative effects of this lemming-like behavior and the reflection of this downward spiral in the revolting newspeak that has taken over the mass media and the lovely commercial social networks. Because what we are experiencing right now by means of a soft transformation, is a totalitarian take-over while the majority of the artists are focused on career, money and reputation instead of resistance, subversion and reflection. &quot;",

A small subset of these features is activated at any given time on individual devices based on its specific configuration. An even smaller subset of features is actually used, as some unused and insecure features cannot are typically enabled by default and cannot be disabled. However, all embedded devices still contain a large amount of code and data that should never be executed or read according to its current configuration. This unnecessary binary is not simply a waste of memory; it contains vulnerable code and data that can be used by an attacker to exploit the system. This “dead code” provides an ideal attack surface. Automated minimization of this attack surface will significantly improve the security of the device without any impact to the device’s functionality. &quot;",

The firmware binary corresponding to the features enabled in the configuration is kept. The firmware corresponding to features not enabled in the configuration is removed from the firmware image. The firmware to be removed is determined by applying static and dynamic binary code analysis on the original firmware image. This analysis maps each configurable feature with a set of binary executable code within the firmware image. When a particular configuration is analyzed, a list of enabled features is built from this file. Using the feature to code mapping created from the original dynamic and static analysis, autotomic binary reduction simply removes all code that belongs to features that are not enabled, or should not be used, in the particular configuration file in question. \r\n\r\nWe present quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of Binary Autotomy algorithms on a collection of common embedded devices along with several live demonstrations of embedded devices running post FFC firmware images.

                        "description": "&quot;Attribute Based Credentials (ABC) allow users to prove certain properties about themselves (e.g. age, race, license, etc.) without revealing their full identity. They provide unlinkability, both between issuance of the credential and subsequebtly proving ownership of the credential, as well as between subsequent ownership proces at a service provider. This makes it impossible to track a user as she uses her credentials on the web. This makes ABCs a powerful privacy enhancing technology.\r\n\r\nSmart cards are an appealing container to store such credenentials: they are secure, and can be caried by the user in an ordinary wallet. However, ABC use complex cryptography to achieve their privacy preserving properties, thus far evading efficient implementations on such smart cards. The IRMA (I Reveal My Attributes) project of the Radboud University Nijmegen (together with SURFnet and TNO) has created the first full and efficient implementation of this technology on smart cards. The implementation is based on the Idemix technology orginally developed by IBM. The smart card is contactless, to allow NFC enabled smart phones and tablets as readers. This makes it easy to use IRMA cards on the web, or to prove credentials in a small shop on the tablet owned by the shopkeeper. \r\n\r\nWe will discuss ABCs in general, the IRMA system and it&#x27;s implementation particular, and give a demo of how an IRMA card can be used in practice (using a smart phone as the card reader). More importantly though we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of ABC technology, compared to other identity management approaches. We will especially discuss the risk of having a ubiquitous authentication infrastructure that ABCs would provide when implemented on national identity cards, and outline ways to mitigate these risks.\r\n&quot;",

We will also demonstrate these techniques and discuss how we were able to discover them using several ARM hardware development platforms that we custom built.  Where relevant we will also discuss ARM exploitation as it related to Android as we wrote about in the 'Android Hackers Handbook' which we co-authored and will be released in October 2013 (http://www.amazon.com/Android-Hackers-Handbook-Joshua-Drake/dp/111860864X)\r\n\r\nLastly, we will also discuss some of our most recent related hardware research (to facilitate the above) which will include bus protocol eavesdropping/reverse engineering, demystifying hardware debugging, and surreptitiously obtaining embedded software (firmware) using hardware techniques. We will demonstrate and show the supportive tools used and techniques developed to perform this work and deploy them against Apple MFI iAP devices, and multimedia devices using OEM implemented USB stacks. (Which will briefly include our experiences around starting http://int3.cc where we sell a fully assembled modified version of a hardware USB fuzzer.) \r\n\r\nAlong the way we will inevitably share some of the lessons we also learned while completely designing the hardware (from scratch), writing the firmware, and mobile apps for an embedded security device called Osprey (http://int3.cc/collections/frontpage/products/osprey) that we hold the patent for and have been publicly about publicly as a hardware vulnerability assessment swiss-army-knife for researchers.\r\n&quot;",

These schemes often employ cryptographically secure protocols. The weakest link of such a scheme is the chip itself. By attacking the chip directly an attacker can gain access to the secret data in its unencrypted form. In this presentation we demonstrate the attack class of the future, backside attacks. This class of attacks mitigate all device countermeasures and can access all signals of the device. As opposed to the attacks of today, these attacks can also be applied to complex systems such as the ARM SoCs of modern smartphones.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;Over recent years hackers and chip manufacturers have been deadlocked in the field of integrated circuit security. From reverse engineering proprietary cryptographic algorithms and microprobing bus lines to fault injection and side cannel attacks, every class of attack has ushered in new preventative countermeasures. Most attacks to date are performed from the frontside where all the active areas and circuit nodes are accesible. Hence, all countermeasures, such as shields and meshes, also  focus on mitigating attacks from the frontside. Security relevant signals are burried under many layers of metalization to make them inaccessible to frontside attackers.\r\nThe direct consequence is that backside attacks become significantly more appealing. With comprably little effort, many old-school attacks are once again possible. Setting or resetting fuses, probing wires or even single transistors is possible, not only with needles but with electron beams or lasers. More exotic attacks are feasible from the backside as well. For example, in switching transistors some of the electrons induce photons that can be seen with an infrared camera during execution. The opposite, i.e. iducing laser light, can also result in successful glitching attacks.\r\nCurrently, there are is little IC vendors can do to prevent such attacks.&quot;",

While such scanning behavior is often associated with botnets and worms, it also has proved to be a powerful methodology for security research.  Recent studies, beginning with the EFF&#x27;s SSL Observatory, have demonstrated that Internet-wide scanning can help reveal new kinds of vulnerabilities, monitor deployment of mitigations, and shed light on previously opaque distributed ecosystems.  Unfortunately, this methodology has been more accessible to attackers than to researchers without access to botnets or willingness to spread self-replicating code.  Comprehensively scanning the public address space with off-the-shelf tools like Nmap requires weeks of time or many machines.\r\n\r\nTo make Internet-wide scanning more accessible, my research team recently introduced &lt;a href='https://zmap.io'&gt;ZMap&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source network scanner that is designed from the ground up to perform Internet-scale port scans.  In our tests using a gigabit Ethernet uplink, ZMap scans the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes from a single machine, more than 1300 times faster than Nmap.  By the time of the talk, we&#x27;ll have switched to a 10 gigE uplink, which should theoretically support scanning the entire address space in under 5 minutes.  I&#x27;ll explain how ZMap&#x27;s architecture enables such high performance by taking advantage of fast modern hardware and recent improvements to the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nWe&#x27;ll work through a series of practical examples that explore the security applications of very fast Internet-scale scanning, both offensive and defensive, and I&#x27;ll share experiences from conducting more than 300 Internet-wide scans over the past 18 months, totaling well over 1 trillion probes.  I&#x27;ll describe how we completed hundreds of scans targeting every public HTTPS server (each scan larger than the entire SSL Observatory) in order to shed light on the growth of HTTPS deployments and expose security problems within the HTTPS ecosystem, such as misissued CA certs and widespread server misconfiguration.  I&#x27;ll show how high-speed scanning can be used to expose vulnerable hosts, using IPMI and UPnP vulnerabilities as recent examples.  Malicious attackers could abuse this capability to exploit 0day vulnerabilities affecting millions of hosts within hours of a problem&#x27;s discovery, and better defenses are badly needed.  Finally, I&#x27;ll discuss applications to Internet freedom, including discovering unadvertised services such as hidden Tor bridges (used for censorship resistance) and Bluecoat devices (used for state-sponsored censorship).\r\n\r\nHigh-speed scanning can be a powerful tool in the hands of security researchers, but users must be careful not to cause harm by inadvertently overloading networks or causing unnecessary work for network administrators.  I&#x27;ll discuss the complaints and other reactions my group&#x27;s scanning has generated--on one occasion we were mistaken for an Iranian DoS attack on U.S. banks, and we received a visit from the FBI--and I&#x27;ll suggest several guidelines and best practices for good Internet citizenship while scanning.\r\n\r\nWe are living in a unique period in the history of the Internet: widely available networks are becoming fast enough to quickly and exhaustively scan the IPv4 address space, yet IPv6 (with its much larger address space) has not yet been widely deployed.  I hope this talk will help researchers make the most of this window of opportunity. \r\n&quot;",

Once theoretical &amp; remote, such scenarios have lately been revealed as a stark reality.\r\n\r\nBut what if we could have every individual piece of software or firmware in the binary toolchain bug-free, performing just as their programmers intended? Would we be safe from run-away computation if only well-formed inputs to each of the individual tools were allowed? Not so. Potential for malicious computation lurks in a variety of input formats along all steps of the binary runtime process construction and execution. Until the 'glue' data of an ABI and the binary toolchains in general is reduced to predictable, statically analyzable power, plenty of room for bug-less Trojans remains.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss our latest work in constructing Turing-complete computation out of different levels of metadata, present tools to normalize and disambiguate these metadata, and conclude with proposals for criteria to trust binary toolchains beyond 'Trusting trust' compilers and planted bugs.&quot;",

In particular, we will show how parser differentials between images as verified and as loaded, or as seen by the kernel and the RTLD can result in completely different view of the loadable segments (and, as a result, of the runtime space). &quot;",

                        "description": "&quot;&lt;p&gt;Using the recent &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREACH_%28security_exploit%29'&gt;BREACH&lt;/a&gt; exploit as an example, I will present how to represent attacks and security notions within the Type Theory of &lt;a href='http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/'&gt;Agda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Using security notions such as semantic security (&lt;code&gt;IND-CPA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IND-CCA&lt;/code&gt;), it is intuitive to show how the use of compression leads to a not semantically secure encryption, and thus potential issues. Indeed the length of the ciphertext can now be controlled by the adversary who can control the plaintext. I will show how this intuitive result can be formalized using &lt;a href='http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/'&gt;Agda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A note on &lt;a href='http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/'&gt;Agda&lt;/a&gt;: It is both a programming language and a proof system. The programming language features pure, exhaustive, and terminating functions over rich user defined data types (inductive and co-inductive). This powerful λ-calculus is equipped with a rich type-system featuring dependent-types. Through the Curry-Howard correspondence this programming language can also be used as a proof system. With such a combined system it becomes possible to write programs and proofs about these programs in a unified way. Additionally using this approach, one can start proving properties starting only with programming skills and gradually learn more proof techniques by exploring the type system.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I claim that functional programming and dependent types can be of a great help to formalize cryptography and thus privacy enhancing tools. I will present how functions are convenient at describing these games and adversaries. I will also give an overview of the crypto-agda project: how type-isomorphisms can ease probabilistic reasoning; how circuits can help capturing the requirements on the complexity bounds; and how all of these aspects can fit together thanks to polymorphism!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&quot;",

I will demonstrate the journey I took and give a short introduction to how the data is actually encoded.

Typical side-channels like the power consumption and the EM emanation are introduced. The main focus is then on three case studies that have been conducted as part of the SCA research of the Chair for Embedded Security (Ruhr-Uni Bochum) since 2008:\r\n\r\nThe first example are FPGAs that can be protected against reverse-engineering and product counterfeit with a feature called 'bitstream encryption'. Although the major vendors (Xilinx and Altera) use secure ciphers like AES, no countermeasures against SCA were implemented. \r\nAs a second example, a wide-spread electronic locking system based on proprietary cryptography is analyzed. The target of the third case study is a popular one-time password token for two-factor authentication, the Yubikey 2.\r\n\r\nIn all three cases, the cryptographic secrets could be recovered within a few minutes to a few hours of measurements, allowing an adversary to decrypt FPGA bitstreams, to clone Yubikeys, and to open all locks in an entire installation, respectively. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we summarize possible countermeasures against the presented attacks and describe the communication with the respective vendors as part of a responsible disclosure process.   &quot;",

Information about the camera and its lens, shutter speed and aperture, date and time, &amp;c, have been bundled into the JPEG since the early days of digital photography. By now, that photo is likely to include a GPS trace as well, and as soon as it leaves your camera, computers are hard at work assisting you in identifying and tagging people and places, with auto-completing textual clarity and database precision. Meanwhile NSA spooks try to reassure us that they are only interested in the &lt;i&gt;metadata&lt;/i&gt; of our communications--the who and the when, and maybe some keywords. Without denying a power and efficacy to machine-readable metadata, I argue that for humans to navigate and find meaning in unknown and unsorted material, this search will require multi-media tools that immerse us and augment our powers of perception, rather than reduce all navigation to textfields, transcripts, and tags. For temporal media (sound and video), codecs have given us greater and greater instantaneous fidelity, but leave us with few techniques to skim, seek, and survey.\r\n\r\nUsing case studies of documentary film, Freedom of Information Law document dumps, soundbanks, and a hacker conference, I will demonstrate experiments and results of several years developing open source tools to reorient the idea of documentary around its documents.&quot;",

In proper style of a home-delivery-service, anyone who picked up their telephone, was able to listen to the on-going opera performances for as long as s/he wanted through a live connection with the audio bug signal. The Zurich Opera launched a search for the bugs and in a first reaction threatened to take legal action if the transmissions were not stopped and the bugs not removed. \r\n\r\n«Delivery for Mr. Assange» is a live mail art piece.

This controller is an attack surface of interest. First, the ability to modify the block allocation and erasure algorithms introduces the opportunity to perform various MITM attacks in a virtually undetectable fashion. Second, the controller itself is typically powerful, with performance around 50MIPS, yet with a cost of mere pennies, making it an interesting and possibly useful development target for other non-storage related purposes. Finally, understanding the inner workings of the controller enables opportunities for data recovery in cards that are thought to have been erased, or have been partially damaged.\r\n\r\nThis talk demonstrates a method for reverse engineering and loading code into the microcontroller within a SD memory card.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;TECHNICAL APPROACH\r\n\r\nPublicly available documentation on SD card controllers is scarce.  However, based upon tear-down and decap analysis as well as a survey of the publicly available product briefs, most controllers are believed to be either an enhanced 8051, or an ARM derivative.\r\n\r\nA further challenge to overcome is the fact that SD card manufacturers typically reserve the right to change the controller IC within a card without updating the external markings to reflect the change. This policy favors the SD card manufacturers, as it allows them to swap out existing controllers for lower-cost devices as new controllers are introduced. However, it is problematic for users as it means that two otherwise identical looking cards can have different performance and/or bugs with which to contend.\r\n\r\nTo kick off the effort, a survey of available cards was made at an SD card gray market in Shenzhen, China. Each card was dissected and visually inspected for cues, such as the layout of the traces going to the controller glob-top, that would indicate the type of controller within.  About a dozen different controller types were identified, of which one was picked for further investigation due to its use of SLC FLASH memory.  SLC is a good starting point for reverse engineering because no storage-level scrambling is required to prevent the read and write-disturb issues typical of MLC and TLC FLASH.\r\n\r\nA simple binary dump of the FLASH memory within the card revealed structure within the first erase block consistent with what we might expect for code storage. Since FLASH memory is inherently unreliable, four CRC + ECC protected copies of code are located within the first sector. This crude duplication scheme allows the card to boot even if bit errors creep into the code storage sector. We also noted the existence of the string “BUILDWIN” within the code storage sector, which indicates that the controller is likely from a series made by a company called Appotech. Product briefs from the Appotech/Buildwin websites indicated that the architecture of the code is likely an 8051-derivative, and the model of the controller is probably an AX211.\r\n\r\nAt this point, our effort to reverse engineer the controller split into two paths. One path was static analysis, where extracted binaries and manufacturing-related tools were analyzed with IDA to determine key entry points, storage locations, and most importantly a method for injecting code into the card via the SD interface. The other path was dynamic analysis, where the signals going to the SD card bus and to the NAND FLASH were instrumented with logging and stimulus facilities, and the controller&#x27;s operation could be observed with exquisite resolution, enabling a broad class of fuzzing and other brute-force analysis attacks, as well as the rapid confirmation or rejection of hypotheses generated by static analysis. Dynamic analysis was key in determining features such as the location of the GPIO control registers and the function and format of otherwise undocumented extended instruction opcodes.\r\n\r\nThe static analysis path was assisted by the availability of official firmware burning routines, scavenged from Chinese language file-sharing websites. These are tools normally used during the production of SD cards, but made available on the gray market to enable (and correct) card capacity expansion fraud. Typically, these tools are used to flash an incorrect version of the firmware onto the SD cards, which would identify the card as having a much higher capacity than the physically available storage.  This would allow unscrupulous dealers to sell, for example, aging 128MiB silicon as devices identifying themselves with 2GiB capacity. These bootleg tools would come with a collection of firmware blobs for loading onto the card, as well as a routine that communicates to a proprietary USB-based burning device. We did not have access to the burner, but static analysis of the communication protocol via code reverse engineering revealed that firmware loading is initiated through the application of a specific “secret knock” sequence during card boot.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic analysis path was implemented using an embedded platform of our making, known publicly as Novena. It is a quad-core ARM CPU running Linux mated to a Spartan 6 FPGA with a high speed expansion port. The FPGA also has a 256 MiB DDR3 buffer slaved off of it. This buffer + FPGA was used to implement a combination logic analyzer + ROM emulator used to wrap the controller on the SD card. The ROM emulator presents a virtual, dual-ported NAND FLASH device to the SD card controller. The dual-port design allows us to modify and read the contents of the NAND FLASH on the fly, thereby allowing us to stimulate the controller IC with various fault conditions or code loops and measure its effect on the FLASH device. This tight coupling enabled us to rapidly discover, for example, which SFRs (Special Function Registers) are responsible for reading or writing to the Flash controller hardware. Furthermore, each port of the SD card controller is connected to a virtual logic analyzer within the FPGA that can store up to a 16MiB trace of transactions going to and from the controller from both the SD and FLASH buses. This very deep buffer length allowed us to observe behavior of the device from power-on to full operation, as well as observe stimulus-response loops to compound SD bus commands.\r\n\r\nSD INTERFACE OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nBefore diving into the details of our approach, we review a few important aspects of the SD protocol. When an SD card first boots, it is running in SD/MMC mode.  This is a 9-wire protocol, using the following pinout (note: pin 9 is located below and to the side of pin 1):\r\n\r\n 12345678\r\n9|||||||\\- DAT1\r\n|||||||\\-- DAT0\r\n||||||\\--- GND\r\n|||||\\---- Clock\r\n||||\\----- VDD +3.3V\r\n|||\\------ GND\r\n||\\------- Command\r\n|\\-------- DAT3\r\n\\--------- DAT2\r\n\r\nSD commands consist of a start bit of 0, a sync bit of 1, a 6-bit command number (referred to as CMDn, where n is between 0 and 63,) four 8-bit arguments, a CRC7 checksum, and a stop-bit of 1. This yields a total of 48-bits (or 6 bytes) per command.\r\n\r\nWhile the card is processing the request, it will keep the Command line high, and will begin its communication with a start bit by bringing the Command line low, indicating '0'. This will be followed by 38 bits of data, 7 bits of crc7, and a stop bit of '1', for a total of 48 bits.\r\n\r\nBit values are sampled when the clock line is high, and may change when the clock line is low. Bytes are sent from high to low. For example, hex value 0x80 would be written out as 0b10000000. CMD0 must be sent before any other commands are processed. To send such a command, transmit the following six byes.\r\n\r\n{0x40 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x95}\r\n    |    |    |    |    |    \\----- (CRC7 of ({0x40, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}))&lt;&lt;1 | 1\r\n    |    \\----\\----\\----\\---------- Four arguments of '0'\r\n    \\------------------------------ Start bit of 0, cmd bit of 1, CMD0)\r\n\r\nThen, continue to wiggle the clock, and look for the 48-bit response.  Data is transmitted either on the DAT0 line (for 1-bit mode), or striped in parallel across DAT0-DAT3. As with the Command line, bit 7 is sent first, and bit 0 is sent last. In four-bit mode, DAT3 will send bit 7, DAT2 will send bit 6, DAT1 will send bit 5, and DAT4 will send bit 4.  Bits 3-0 will be sent using DAT3-DAT0 on the next clock cycle.\r\n\r\nData is transmitted with a start bit of 0, followed by the data (almost always 512 bytes), followed by a CRC16 of the data, and then a stop bit of 1. In the case of 4-bit mode, all four DAT lines send a start bit of 0, and each individual line sends its own CRC16 of the transmitted data. All four lines send a stop bit of 1, as well.\r\n\r\nCONTROLLER-SPECIFIC NOTES\r\n\r\nThe AX211 is based on the 8051 architecture, which is an eight-bit processor core that is very common among embedded parts. The original 8051 ran at around 1 MIPS, but improvements in architecture and clock speed allows the 8051 present in the AX211 to run at 50 MIPS. The 8051 instruction set had a single undefined opcode of 0xa5, which is used by Appotech to implement 32-bit instruction set extensions. \r\n\r\nThe hardware SD protocol engine only handles transferring bytes (OSI layers 1 &amp; 2). The higher-level details of the SD protocol set is implemented entirely in software, making for a compelling attack surface. When the processor first starts up it attempts to load a valid flash image off of the NAND. While it is in this state, it can respond to a limited set of SD commands, including 'RESET', 'Set CRC7 required', and 'Set voltage'. It will not respond to the 'Go Ready' command until it has loaded its firmware. There are four copies of the AX211 firmware, located at NAND offset 0x0000, 0x10000, 0x20000, and 0x30000. Each copy is protected with its own error correcting code. If all four copies are sufficiently damaged, or if the NAND is missing or blank, then the card will never fully boot, and will never be able to go ready.\r\n\r\nFACTORY PROGRAMMER\r\n\r\nAs noted previously, we had found a copy of the Windows-based AX211 factory programming tool off of Chinese-language file sharing websites. The full AX211 factory programming suite is a combination of this software and a proprietary (and unknown to us) hardware tool. We suspect the hardware is based on the AppoTech AX2002 processor, which also uses an 8051-compatible instruction set. The device connects to the main PC through USB, and has the USB ID string of 'appotechcksd'. This allows the software to identify the programmer regardless of its product/vendor ID. We believe the device may have a small display, or else it prints debugging information out a serial port. The programming software is almost entirely in Chinese. It does not contain a codepage identifier, so a system must be set to run non-Unicode programs as 'Chinese (PRC)', which selects an encoding of GB-18030. If you do not do this, the software will display gibberish in place of Chinese text.\r\n\r\nThe programmer control software appears to be fully automated. Without the programmer hardware, we can only configure the software and see where, presumably, individual hardware programmers would appear in the user interface. Therefore, we must resort to disassembling the binary to determine how it works. Code flow analysis indicates that when the software initially detects the attachment of factory programming hardware via USB, it opens the device and sends a binary file called '2005FM.BIN'. 2005FM.BIN is a raw opcode stream that is loaded into the programmer hardware&#x27;s 8051 (not the SD target) at address 0. The program begins running from address 0, and begins doing some initialization. It then displays the string 'RUN' through the putative logging interface on the programming hardware. After this, it awaits further control instructions from the host.\r\n\r\nThe microcontroller used in the programmer hardware does not contain an SD/MMC host controller. This is fortunate for us, as it means the SD programming interface is implemented entirely using GPIOs. This makes it easy to trace all signal changes through static code analysis.\r\n\r\nWhen programming begins, the programmer places the SD card into a special mode where it will accept and execute programs. It does this by sending SD CMD0 (card reset) followed within 20 msec by CMD63 with the arguments &#x27;A&#x27; &#x27;P&#x27; &#x27;P&#x27; &#x27;O&#x27; and the appropriate crc7 checksum. The card then responds with the following sequence:\r\n\r\n{0x3f 0x00 0x9d 0x20 0x0b 0x35}\r\n    |    |    |    |    |    \\-- CRC7 checksum, plus stop bit\r\n    |    \\----\\----\\----\\------- Unknown values\r\n    \\---------------------------- The command we sent (CMD63)\r\n\r\nThe program to be executed on the SD card is then loaded to offset 0x2900, and will begin executing immediately from within an interrupt context. Therefore, the first thing the routine should do is escape the context by changing the return value, then issuing a 'reti' command.\r\n\r\nWhen the host software detects a new card to be programmed, it informs the programmer to put the card into this special factory mode, and then begins uploading firmware and communicating with the card. The first program to get loaded is a small piece of test code called TestBoot.bin.  The program performs a few sanity checks, then returns pass or fail by sending the result out the Command line. Once the program finishes, control returns to the AX211 ROM.\r\n\r\nAfter TestBoot.bin runs, the programmer loads a file called communication.bin. This program contains a full interrupt vector table, and is therefore able to replace functions such as SD communication and NAND access. It uses this to load a new, expanded set of communication options, including the ability to load and execute another program at memory offset 0x800. Because it has its own interrupt vector table, it loads at offset 0, and takes control of the entire card.\r\n\r\nOnce the communications program is loaded, the programmer uses it to load more advanced programs that actually deal with the NAND flash component. Programs are loaded at offset 0x800 in order to allow the communications program (and its interrupt vector table) to stay resident.\r\n\r\nThe first program loaded is FLASH_SCAN.BIN, which is responsible for scanning the flash to determine its properties. This can be useful when operators are not familiar with the type of NAND they&#x27;re working with.  This program is able to inform the host of properties such as the page size, flash size, and ECC data. The host can then use this information to construct a Card ID block.\r\n\r\nIt&#x27;s important to note that the host controller can choose to ignore the information coming from the flash, and can program invalid flash sizes.  This can occur either deliberately or accidentally. Thus, some 'counterfeit' cards may simply be a result of an operator forgetting to change the settings when programming a new batch of NAND.\r\n\r\nAfter the flash has been scanned, a program called FLASH_PRO.BIN is loaded. This is responsible for the actual programming of the NAND with the requisite firmware file. With FLASH_PRO.BIN running, the programmer must feed the card a firmware file. A wide variety of firmwares are bundled with the programming software, and vary between the vendor, page size, block size, number of planes, and the number of chip enables. The host picks an appropriate firmware file to send, and writes it out to the card.\r\n\r\nAfter programming is complete, the programmer resets the card and formats it. Depending on the size of the card, the programmer places either a FAT16 or a FAT32 header on the card, and creates the actual file allocation table. It is interesting to note that there are two DOS MBRs stored in the 2005FM.BIN programmer firmware, complete with an NTLDR boot sector. This gets placed at the head of the card, with the actual file allocation table following shortly after.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of reversing the factory programmer binaries is the development of our own routines which is capable of knocking the AX211 and loading our own code onto the device.\r\n\r\nAX211 FIRMWARE REVERSING\r\n\r\nThe contents of the programs run on the AX211 has also been analyzed. In addition to confirming the host-side initialization protocols documented above, the firmware reversing effort has revealed more details on the allocation of instruction set enhancements and the Function Specific Registers (FSRs). FSRs are memory-mapped registers that are used to control and configure the state of the hardware. For example, the pins required to turn NAND I/Os into GPIOs and toggle their values is contained in the FSR region; therefore discovering the FSR map is an important component of achieving maximum utility from the SD card controller.\r\n\r\nOpcode extensions on the 8051 are accomplished by using the escape opcode 0xA5. This is the only opcode function in the 8051 which doesn&#x27;t have a pre-defined value. Typically, the escape opcode is followed by one or more bytes that specify which escape sequence to use. In our investigation of the firmware, we have only seen one and two-byte escape sequences. Two-byte sequences require that the lower nibble of the first escape opcode to be 1&#x27;s. We have modified the 8051 processor module in IDA to handle these escape sequences gracefully. Our current theory is that the opcode extensions are used to trigger various NAND interface functions, such as transmitting a command cycle or computing ECC on a loaded page of memory. \r\n\r\nThe FSR map was determined in part through static binary code analysis in IDA, and in part through a dynamic fuzzing infrastructure. For example, to determine which FSR was used as a GPIO, we wrote a small assembly stub that would set a pseudo-random (based upon a seed value, so we could reproduce experiments later on) selection of four FSR registers within the 128-byte window of valid FSRs to 0xFF, then 0x00, with a few microseconds&#x27; delay between. We had connected an oscilloscope to one of the NAND I/Os on the AX211, and monitored for changes in I/O status while running this code. We decided to write four bytes at once under the theory that we had to configure not only a data register, but also direction &amp; configuration registers as well to be outputs for us to measure a change using the oscilloscope. With some luck, we were able to discover very quickly an FSR which, when written to, would cause some of the NAND I/O pins to flip on and off.\r\n\r\nThrough this combination of static and dynamic analysis, we have confirmed the function of much of the FSR table, which looks like this: \r\n\r\n     |   0   |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |\r\n     |   8   |   9   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |   E   |   F   |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n 80  | SDMOD |  SP   |  DPL  |  DPH  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n 88  | SDOS  | SDI4  | SDI3  | SDI2  | SDI1  | SDCMD | IACK  |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n 90  | SDSM  |       |       | SDBL  | SDBH  |       | SDDL  | SDDH  |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n 98  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n A0  | NTYPE | NCMD  | NRAML | NRAMH |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n A8  |  IE   | NCMD1 | NCMD2 | NADD0 | NADD1 | NADD2 | NADD3 | NADD4 |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n B0  |       | RAND  |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n B8  | ER8   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n C0  | ER00  | ER01  | ER02  | ER03  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n C8  | ER10  | ER11  | ER12  | ER13  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n D0  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n D8  | ER20  | ER21  | ER22  | ER23  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n E0  | ACC   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n E8  |       |       | NFMT  | SDDIR |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n F0  | B     |       | NPRE1 | NPRE2 |       |       | PORT1 |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n F8  | ER30  | ER31  | ER32  | ER33  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\nOur presumption is many of the spots reading back as 00 are probably unused FSRs, so we have probably uncovered the function of most of the implemented FSRs.\r\n\r\nWORKING IT: A REPL DEBUGGER\r\n\r\nIn investigating the actual runtime firmware of the AX211 card, it has become apparent that the entire SD engine at the protocol level is implemented in 8051 code. Only the SD physical layer (including both SPI and MMC mode) is handled in hardware. When the host controller sends a command such as CMD0, the host controller actually treats the command as an offset in a jump table. Application commands are also treated in a separate jump table. This means that it is a trivial matter to add an additional command. All one needs to do is co-opt one of the unused commands, which currently point to a default handler. There is plenty of space at the end of the firmware to add any additional commands.\r\n\r\nNow that the SD controller&#x27;s functions are well known, we were able to implement a REPL-mode debugger firmware for the SD controller:\r\n\r\nroot@bunnie-novena:~/ax211-code# ./ax211 -d debugger.bin\r\nFPGA hardware v1.26\r\nDebug mode APPO response [6]: {0x3f 0x00 0xc1 0x04 0x17 0xab}\r\nResult of factory mode: 0\r\n00000000 0f 41 1f 0f 0f 0f ff ff |.A......|\r\nExpected 0x00 0x00, got 0x0f 0x41\r\nLoaded debugger\r\nLocating fixup hooks...

Therefore, in order to implement a rich command feature set, the debugger functions are partitioned between a host CPU (the ARM i.MX6) and the target 8051-based CPU. For example, disassembling a particular region of memory breaks down to a script executed on the host side that drives the native AX211 stub code to dump the requested portion of memory to disassemble, followed up with the disassembly algorithm running on the host ARM CPU.\r\n\r\nThe only way to talk to the AX211 is via the SD interface. Therefore, the interactive REPL environment must run on the host ARM system, which is equipped with the requisite terminal interface features such as a ssh console. The REPL environment then translates the user&#x27;s requests into bundles of SD commands. We take advantage of the command/response token protocol built into the SD-PHY spec (see page 8 of SD Card Physical Layer Simplified Specification v2.00 for more information). The command/response protocol runs bidirectionally on a single wire, the CMD line of the SD-PHY interface, and is timed by the CLK line. Command tokens are 48-bits long, and contain a CRC along with some static header bits. Response tokens are also 48 bits long, and similarly feature CRC protection along with different static header bits. The SD commands originating from the REPL environment are transmitted to the AX211 via the FPGA built into the host system. The FPGA presents a “gpio-like” API for the SD host PHY: one register for data output, one register for data input, and one register to bit-wise set the data direction. \r\n\r\nThe SD commands are received on the AX211 and processed by the hardware SD engine attached to the embedded 8051 CPU. The state machine handles receiving the data and computing/checking the CRC.  Once a complete packet is received by the state machine, the 8051 is notified of the packet&#x27;s arrival via an interrupt.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the 512 bytes of native 8051 code for our debugger contains the following routines:\r\n\r\n* An entry sequence that resets the execution environment and redirects ongoing code execution into the debug.bin patch\r\n* An interrupt handler for receiving SD command packets\r\n* Code to set the ISR handler to our new interrupt handler\r\n* A jump table to parse incoming SD commands\r\n* Helper routines, such as the response transmission and wait loops\r\n* Implementation of all the basic stub commands:\r\n  * hello - inform the host we&#x27;re running\r\n  * echo - loop back the request\r\n  * peek - request contents of XRAM\r\n  * poke - set contents of XRAM\r\n  * jump - run code at an address\r\n  * nand - manipulate the NAND hardware registers\r\n  * SFR/IRAM get/set routines - more on this below\r\n  * extended opcode - execute an extended opcode\r\n  * error - return an error code\r\n\r\nCROSS-MEMORY AREA ACCESS\r\n\r\nThe 8051 has two different kinds of memory, each of which is further subdivided:\r\n\r\nIRAM - located on-chip. 256 bytes in total. Accessed using 'mov' instruction. The IRAM map is as follows:\r\n  * IRAM address 0-7 corresponds to CPU registers R0-R7\r\n  * IRAM address 8-0x7f are on-chip RAM\r\n  * IRAM address 0x80-0xff are Special Function Registers (SFRs). SFRs are locations that are mapped to hardware functions, such as the NAND command engine or GPIO\r\n\r\nXRAM - 16 kilobytes of 'External' RAM (this memory was a physically separate chip in the original non-embedded 8051 implementation). Accessed by storing an address in DPTR (which is really made up of SFR 0x82 and 0x83, called DPL and DPH respectively) and either loading to the accumulator using 'movx A, @DPTR' or storing from the accumulator using 'movx @DPTR, A'. The XRAM map is as follows:\r\n  * 0x0000 - 0x0006 is reserved. Contains 0x51 0x00 0x00 0x00 ...\r\n  * 0x0007 - 0x01ff is protected and returns 0xff. The CPU and NAND block can&#x27;t read this range, but the SD block can.\r\n  * 0x0200 - 0x0202 is interrupt vector 0 (SPI)\r\n  * 0x0203 - 0x0205 is interrupt vector 1 (other SPI)\r\n  * 0x0206 - 0x0208 is interrupt vector 2 (NAND)\r\n  * 0x0209 - 0x020b is interrupt vector 3 (unknown)\r\n  * 0x020c - 0x02af is general-purpose RAM\r\n  * Code execution for APPO factory mode begins at offset 0x2900\r\n  * 0x2ba0 - 0x2bff contains something interesting, and I&#x27;m not sure what\r\n  * 0x2c00 - 0x3fff is read-only and contains zeroes\r\n  * 0x0000 - 0x3fff is mirrored at 0x4000, 0x8000, and 0xc000\r\n\r\nThe division of 8051 memory space into IRAM and XRAM presents a unique challenge for debugger implementation.  Not being able to index into IRAM means that one cannot dereference a variable pointer into IRAM. In the 8051 ISA, only constant values can be dereferenced into IRAM. This pseudo code draws a loose analogy of the situation in C-like syntax:\r\n\r\niram_vaule = *iram_pointer; // ERROR: variable values not allowed\r\niram_value = *(0x42); // ACCEPTABLE: only hard-coded constant values allowed\r\n\r\nThis limitation of the 8051 architecture present a challenge in implementing a key feature of the debugger, namely enabling the dynamic exploration of the IRAM and associated SFR space.  \r\n\r\nFortunately, on the AX211, the debugger code is loaded into XRAM, which can be indexed via the DPTR register using the MOVX instruction. This allows the debugger to manipulate its own code, thereby allowing us to change, for example, the offset constant to a MOV instruction inside the debugger.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to implement peek and poke in the IRAM space (and likewise enable convenient exploration of the SFRs), we reserve three-byte slots in debug.bin using a sentinel sequence of invalid opcodes that are unique and searchable.  \r\n\r\nOnce debug.bin is loaded, one of the first tasks the host program does is scan the loaded program for the unique sequences and records their offsets. These sequences are then replaced on-demand with the appropriate instructions to implement the required MOV opcodes to explore arbitrary locations in IRAM.  \r\n\r\nBelow is a concrete example of this technique as implemented in the debugger. The following code snippet is from debugger.asm:\r\n\r\ncmd_sfr_get:\r\n  ; This will get replaced by 'mov 0x20, [SFR]' at runtime\r\n  .db 0xa5, 0x60, 0x61\r\n  mov 0x21, #0\r\n  mov 0x22, #0\r\n  mov 0x23, #0\r\n  sjmp xmit_response\r\n\r\nHere, we are looking at the “SFR get” stub. The arguments to return to the host are loaded into IRAM locations 0x20-0x23. For example,\r\n\r\n  mov 0x21, #0\r\n\r\nputs the constant value 0 into IRAM 0x21; so in this stub, locations 0x21-0x23 are set to 0, and 0x20 is intended to have the value of the queried SFR. \r\n\r\nA sequence of three bytes, “0xA5 0x60 0x61” is used as a placeholder for a different “mov” instruction that will be slotted in. 0xA5 is the sole invalid opcode in the 8051 instruction set, and therefore it is an “almost safe” opcode (bar collisions with other opcode extensions) to use as the starting marker for a sentinel sequence. The remaining bytes “0x60 0x61” are simply chosen to be unique and non-colliding with other opcode extensions.  \r\n\r\nWhen the user requests the value of an SFR via the REPL interface on the host by typing, for example,\r\n\r\n  sfr -r 0xA0\r\n\r\nthe host issues a command to poke the cached location of the sentinel sequence “0xA5 0x60 0x61” with the sequence “0x85 0x20 0xA0” which represents the instruction\r\n\r\n  mov 0x20 0xA0\r\n\r\nRecall that the only difference between IRAM and SFR is that SFRs have an address greater than 0x80; and furthermore all arguments to the mov are constant, therefore this is a valid 8051 instruction that implements the requested command via the REPL interface.  \r\n\r\nNow that the correct instruction has been installed in the cmd_sfr_get routine, the actual command to run this callback is issued on the SD interface and the requested SFR is returned to the host. This enhanced ability to interrogate the SFR space dynamically allowed us to greatly expand our map of the special function registers.\r\n\r\nEXTENDED OPCODES\r\n\r\nA similar method was used to also explore the extended opcode space for the 8051. As noted in the previous section, “0xA5” is the sole illegal instruction in the native 8051 instruction set, and in enhancements such as the one found in the AX211, it is used as an escape sequence to specify an extended instruction set.  \r\n\r\nAs a (entertaining) side-note, the sparse literature available on the AX211 claims that the on-board 8051 is a 32-bit processor. We originally thought this was an amusing “lost in translation” moment, but in fact, the AX211 implements a set of instructions that operate on 32-bit data types using extended opcodes, thereby lending credibility to the “32-bit” label.  \r\n\r\nSFR locations 0xC0-3, 0xC8-B, 0xD8-B, and 0xF8-B were identified as functioning 32-bit registers, and opcodes were discovered that could reverse the order of bits in these registers, invert the contents of these registers, and clear the contents of these registers to zero. There may be other opcodes present as well; code has been found implementing CRC16 checksums using these 32-bit enhancements, and most likely these enhancements also enable the implementation of MLC/TLC scrambling algorithms. The BCH ECC computations, however, are handled by a dedicated hardware coprocessor.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nAn approach has been disclosed for the exploration and exploitation of the embedded controller found within a particular type of SD card. The approach consists of a combination of static code analysis, and dynamic fuzzing analysis. A 'secret knock' for uploading code into the controller was found, and through this mechanism we explored the register map and extended opcodes of the microcontroller. Significantly, in this particular device all of the SD protocol-layer commands are implemented in software. This allowed us to redefine the SD protocol set and implement, as a demonstration, a REPL-mode debugger for the SD card.&quot;",

This is a high water mark in civilisation. Since then, at least in the west, we have enjoyed an unprecedented degree of freedom and prosperity. In the subsequent decades further victories were won around equal rights on issues of race, gender, or sexuality. By the 1990s peace appeared to be breaking out around the world, the Cold War was over, and we all lived in an increasingly connected, globalised village. Or did we....\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower coined the phrase 'the military-industrial complex'. He recognised that conflict was good for business, and this had implications for future security. He was prescient. After the racial war was won in the USA, they announced the 'war on drugs' which has disproportionately hit ethnic communities in America; as the Soviet threat receded, so the Islamist threat came to prominence; and as the free flow of information spread over the internet, so the fight-back began with the copyright wars, surveillance, and the crackdown on whistleblowers and organisations such as Wikileaks. We are now facing the 'military-security complex' and an unending, if nebulous, war on concepts.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do about it?\r\n&quot;",

Now, everyone knows, and we are left with a single question, how do we stop this?\r\n\r\nHackers, sysadmins, developers and people of a technical persuasion are neither neutral parties nor spectators to this. We built the internet and we keep it running. We live there. We write the code. We manage the networks. Communications hegemony is impossible without the obedience of the people who build and run the system.\r\n\r\nOur network has become the nervous system of the world. \r\nWe must wake up to this. We must realize the power and responsibility we hold for the great structural problems of our time. This year, Edward Snowden showed that we are not powerless.

The malware is capable of gathering valuable information such as passwords. Because the infected hardware can perform arbitrary main memory accesses, the malware can modify kernel data structures and escalate privileges of processes executed on the system.\r\n\r\nThe malware itself is a DMA malware implementation referred to as DAGGER. DAGGER exploits Intel’s Manageability Engine (ME), that executes firmware code such as Intel’s Active Management Technology (iAMT), as well as its OOB network channel. We have recently improved DAGGER’s capabilites to include support for 64-bit operating systems and a stealthy update mechanism to download new attack code.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;Dedicated hardware such as network interface cards and video controllers can be exploited to conduct a direct memory access (DMA) attack. Direct access means main memory access without the involvement of the host CPU, which in turn means that existing host security software cannot detect or prevent the attack.\r\n\r\nOur presentation covers a DMA malware that benefits from an isolated network channel to update the attack code and to exfiltrate captured data. To be more precise, we show how to conduct a DMA attack using Intel&#x27;s Manageability Engine (ME). Our attack environment is dedicated hardware based on a 32-bit RISC processor called ARCtangent-A4 (ARC4, x86-incompatible) implemented in the chipset of modern Intel platforms. Intel&#x27;s ME executes special firmware such as Intel&#x27;s Active Management Technology (iAMT). The ME/iAMT environment provides an administrator with an Out-of-Band (OOB) network channel to maintain the computer platform remotely. A prominent iAMT feature is the capability to remotely reinstall an operating system that got corrupted and does not boot anymore. iAMT is also available when the platform is in a standby or powered off state. This can be exploited to implement persistent DMA malware. It is needless to say that such a powerful environment must be well protected. Hence, Intel enforces strong isolation of the ME execution environment that makes it perfect to hide malware. The ME is not only implemented in business platforms, but also in consumer platforms.\r\n\r\nOur work does not only show, that an arbitrary attacker is able to perform one of the most dangerous attacks against an iAMT featured platform, but also, that the ME provides a perfect environment for undetectable sensitive data leakage on behalf of the attacker. Our presentation consists of three parts. The first part addresses how to find valuable data in the main memory of the host. The second part exploits the ME&#x27;s OOB network channel to exfiltrate captured data to an external platform and to inject new attack code to target other interesting data structures available in the host runtime memory. The last part deals with the implementation of a covert network channel based on JitterBug.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of our presentation we exploit the DMA engine of Intel&#x27;s ME to find valuable data in the host runtime memory. We have two memory targets. Our first target is the keyboard buffer. We demonstrate how to find the buffer on a Linux as well as on a Windows operating system. Our implementation is called DAGGER - DmA based keyloGGER. We implemented different search strategies for the operating system targets. On Windows we need to find the corresponding CR3 processor register value to get the page directory entries that are needed to map virtual memory addresses into physical ones. We also had to take address randomization into account. The search strategy for the Windows keyboard buffer is mainly based on finding and traversing the so called Object Manager Namespace Directory (OMND). On Linux we implemented a different search strategy. On Linux we have a different starting point for the search phase than on Windows. The implementation to map virtual memory addresses into physical ones is also different. On Linux we can go without page tables. Due to the availability of the Linux source code it was easier to derive a signature for our target structure used by the USB HID driver. \r\n\r\nWe can permanently monitor the keyboard buffer on both operating system targets. Hence, we can capture all user input (passwords, instant messenger sessions, etc.) done via the associated keyboard. Our second memory target concerns the privilege data of an arbitrary process. Again, we use the DMA engine of the ME to find the appropriate data structure. Then we overwrite the existing privileges with root privileges via DMA.\r\n\r\nThe privilege escalation attack actually belongs to the second part of our attack scenario. The implementation is based on an updated version of DAGGER that is able to attack 64-bit operation systems. We demonstrate how to remotely load new attack code (to escalate privileges) to be executed on Intel&#x27;s ME using the isolated OOB channel. To figure out how to exploit the DMA engine to read from the host runtime memory was comparatively easy due to previous work. To figure out how to exploit the ME OOB feature was more challenging. We had to find the ring buffers that iAMT uses to send and receive network packets and the corresponding ring buffer pointers. We also had to find code that is responsible for sending data to an external platform in the 16MB iAMT firmware runtime memory. To get the OOB channel under our control we implemented a breakpoint helper tool. That tool disassembles and displays iAMT code present in the iAMT runtime memory on-the-fly. This enables us to set breakpoints (based on hooks) to check the register content of the ARC4 processor. We were able to identify all necessary OOB channel parts by setting breakpoints and by triggering network events.\r\n\r\nThe last part of our presentation deals with a covert network channel based on JitterBug. The OOB channel is perfect to hide malicious network packets from the host, but not from other monitors present in the network. The aim of the JitterBug based covert network channel is to demonstrate how far an attacker can go with stealthy data exfiltration when using Intel&#x27;s ME as attack environment. Using the JitterBug technique the attacker exfiltrates information by introducing seemingly random delays to some outgoing network packets. The delay pattern can be decoded by an external platform that is under the control of the attacker. Since timing is very important to implement a JitterBug, we had to figure out how to exactly measure time in the ME execution environment. Furthermore, we had to determine which network packets are 'delayable' and how to delay them. To learn how to use the required ME/iAMT components for a JitterBug implementation we developed a more advanced debug tool. This debug tool is based on ARC4 code emulation and it enabled us to collect a huge amount of firmware trace logs that eventually revealed the required parts of the ME/iAMT inner workings. \r\n\r\nIn our talk we will present important runtime memory areas and ARC4 disassemblies of the ARC4 based code. Furthermore, we will present demo videos of our attack scenarios. Please note, we do not present a new security vulnerability to exploit Intel&#x27;s ME.&quot;",

                        "description": "&quot;When it comes to surveillance, the most mainstream argument is that the majority of India&#x27;s population lives below the poverty line and that surveillance is an elitist issue - and not a 'real' issue which affects the masses. \r\n\r\nGiven that the majority of India&#x27;s population has mobile phones and that the Indian government is currently implementing the Central Monitoring System (CMS) which aims at intercepting all telecommunications (and Internet communications), surveillance does not appear to be an elitist issue. Given that the UID scheme aims at collecting the biometric data of all citizens residing in India and that most BPL cash programmes require UID registration, surveillance appears to be an issue which (unfortunately) affects the 1.2 billion people currently living in India. And this is to say the least.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Privacy Project, the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS) in Bangalore, India, is investigating surveillance within the country. The project is funded by Privacy International and aims to map out various forms of surveillance in India, ranging from drones, CCTV cameras and GPS tracking equipment to phone and Internet monitoring gear. \r\n\r\nThis lecture aims to present the research that Maria Xynou has undertaken at the CIS so far, which includes data on the various surveillance technology companies operating in India and the type of spy gear they sell to Indian law enforcement agencies. This research also includes the presentation of India&#x27;s various controversial surveillance schemes, with an emphasis on the Central Monitoring System (CMS) which unlawfully enables the interception of all telecommunications and Internet communications. \r\n\r\nIndia is currently implementing the world&#x27;s largest biometric data collection and interception of communications schemes. The aim of this lecture is to present India&#x27;s scary mass surveillance and to discuss its implications on the right to privacy and other human rights. &quot;",

Not only does the web make it harder to sell advertising on dead trees, it also changes what it means to investigate and tell a good news story. Scoops aren&#x27;t just researched on the phone anymore, but in scraped databases or leaked data dumps. Yet most journalists are missing the skills to access such information effectively. This means two things: we need training for journos and collaborations between hacks and hackers.\r\n\r\nSome news organisations are waking up to this fact: the New York Times has an interactive team that employs some of the best web developers, and the non-profit ProPublica has its own nerd team working as data-driven reporters. Working in a news organisation requires coders to change the way they do things and to focus on telling a good story, rather than building a beautiful application.\r\n\r\nAfter coding on open data applications for a few years, I applied to join OpenNews and to try and build data-driven news applications from inside a news organisation. After a year at Spiegel Online and visiting news orgs around the world, I&#x27;ve explored not just the weird space of online news, but also the kinds of systems that we need to build to enable journalists to run their investigations deeper, and to keep track of the knowledge they collect.&quot;",

                        "abstract": "&quot;The use of encryption to secure sensitive data from unauthorized eyes is as old as human communication itself. Before the relatively new method of computerized encryption software converting data into a format unintelligible to anyone lacking the necessary key for its decryption, for a long time there was pen and paper and the human brain doing quite a bit of work. Up until the 20th century encryption had to be done literally by hand, to then be transmitted in paper form, via telegraphy or radio. In this context, encryption of data has always been of special importance during times of political conflict and war; subsequently, it saw its major developments during those times in history. This talk will examine and explain common hand encryption methods still employed today using the example of one very successful Soviet espionage group operating in Japan in the 1930s and 1940s: the spy ring centered around Richard Sorge, codenamed “Ramsay”.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;In the summer of 1938, the Japanese Secret Police started to notice mysterious radio transmissions emanating from somewhere in the Tokyo area. These transmissions, consisting of seemingly meaningless groups of digits, seemed to be directed towards the Asian mainland; neither the Secret Police nor the Japanese Communications Ministry and the Communications Bureau of the Governor General of Korea were able to pinpoint the where and from more precisely. It wasn&#x27;t until 1941 that Japanese authorities uncovered the full scope and meaning of these messages – by accident and at first disbelieving what they had unearthed.\r\n\r\nThe seemingly gibberish radio transmissions did indeed emanate from the heart of Tokyo and, as it turned out, were received in Vladivostok and passed on to Moscow, to be presented to Stalin himself. Decrypted, they contained vital information about secret German and Japanese plans, even the date of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. This information had been gathered by Richard Sorge, a German citizen with a colorful personality who had infiltrated the small German community in Japan under the guise of a journalist and even gained the friendship and trust of the German ambassador, giving him access to any information available inside the embassy of Japan&#x27;s ally.\r\n\r\nIn Japan since 1933, Sorge had built a spy ring around a small group of confidantes: a Japanese journalist with connections to powerful Japanese political circles, a French-Yugoslav communist, and a German radio technician, Max Clausen.\r\n\r\nClausen&#x27;s technical knowledge proved vital for the group&#x27;s success: he was able to build a transmitter and receiver capable of reaching up to 4,000 km from scratch, using parts available in Tokyo shops without raising suspicion. His radio station was fully portable in a large briefcase and assembled in under 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe dispatches transmitted to the Soviet Union by Sorge&#x27;s group were written in English and then converted into digits using a straddling checkerboard and, to scramble the content even more, a book cipher, using pages from a statistical yearbook as the key. The Japanese authorities were not able to decipher the messages, Sorge&#x27;s encryption method remained unbroken until Max Clausen explained it himself after his arrest in 1941.\r\n\r\nThe historical importance of Sorge&#x27;s espionage material remains a controversial issue among historians; some call him the greatest spy of all times, some argue that since Stalin did not trust his information, Sorge had little influence on the outcome of World War II. Instead of trying to settle this argument, my talk will examine the technical aspects of Sorge&#x27;s work in Japan: I will describe the DIY radio station used to wirelessly transmit his dispatches over thousands of kilometers and show how these dispatches were manually encrypted using nothing but a pen, paper, and a book – suggesting that this method is still valid today, offering low-tech ways of concealing information, be it private or politically delicate material.&quot;",

You have to roll up your sleeves, dig a lot into legal, commercial and administrative stuff. Surprisingly, the technical part is usually not a problem.\r\n\r\nDespite what you could think, there is no need for a big infrastructure, a lot of money, or that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Bayart is at the head of the non-profit organization FDN the oldest ISP still in activity in France. In 2010, he called for the swarming of the concepts behind FDN. The idea was to copy locally what FDN was doing at a country scale and spread the word about self-hosting, Net neutrality and the stakes for society.\r\n\r\nThe call was followed by the creation of several non-profit organizations, quickly federated in a meta-structure called FFDN, for Federation FDN.\r\n\r\n2 years later, FFDN is much bigger. From 7 orgs, there are now 21, counting around 1 400 members.\r\nA human network above the machine&#x27;s one.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, we knew that we were not alone and in the meantime we met with similar organizations around the world, like the Free Network Fundation in the USA or Guifi in Spain.\r\nWe launched an international mailing list to spread the recipes for building open and neutral access to the Internet in many situations. During OHM, this talk helped federating energies around a belgium project and we hope 30C3 will be the occasion to spread the word even more, maybe to give some ideas and plant some seeds for building a better Internet.\r\n\r\nAfter all, Y U NO TRY ?\r\n\r\n&quot;",

PLM is about how to handle versions, communication with users, etc. Every PLM has to be tailor made to the project and the team working on it. PLM is vital to organize open hardware projects to be more focused and efficient, yet being open and adaptive at the same time. Building a PLM is time demanding but will make your projects more and more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt; Our experiences so far &lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt; Our project is the i3 Berlin 3D printer, a remix of the Prusa i3. \r\n- It is an electromechanical project that is mainly built from printed parts and standardized sourced parts.\r\n- We don´t develop electronics, but we do design mechanical parts and make adjustments to the firmware.\r\n- We also sell our design as a kit, which need a manual and a bill of materials that is always up to date. - Furthermore we have to track issues and we want to be open for cooperation by other people. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt; We used Blender to design the entire machine. \r\n- Blender is a 3D mesh modeler, where the industry uses solely parametric CAD software when it comes to electromechanical engineering.\r\n- Parametric 3D models are smart, where mesh models are stupid models you modify with smart tools. \r\n- Mesh modeling is a very suitable method, when 3D printing is the main manufacturing method. Design files are much easier to share among people and programs.\r\n- Cables are an intricate part of a moving machine which can be modeled well within Blender. \r\n- We wrote a plug in to generate a bill of material and developed a method to make a step by step visual manual with animation frames. Both BOM and manual are a part of the design file and therefore these will always be up to date. The rendered pictures from Blenders &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt; For communication we use Github. \r\n- The core ideas and design requirements grow over time in the wiki. \r\n- The submit structure of Github automatically takes care for a version control.\r\n- Git issues work as a support ticket system to track and solve problems. \r\n- Design guidelines make sure that everyone cooperating organizes their work coherently with the project. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt; Future plans &lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt; - make Blender more accessible by making tutorials directly focused on mechanical design. \r\n- connect the BOM with a database for logistics and price calculations and demand estimation,\r\n  supply chain\r\n- continue work on OHM (open hardware management) toolbox &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&quot;",

Because computers basically do the same thing, it&#x27;s not too absurd to try to link these two together. The result is a brain-computer-interface.\r\nThis talk explains the core functionality of our brain and how to access the stored data from the outside. Software and hardware have already reached a somewhat hacker-friendly state, and we want to show you how we got there. We&#x27;re also here to answer all your questions about the brain.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;Communication between humans and computers has great tradition, but also underlies several disadvantages. Interfaces like mice, keyboards or microphones essentially link the user&#x27;s body parts to a computer. When creating new content, these interfaces prove to be relatively inefficient, inaccurate and limited by the user&#x27;s skill.\r\nA good brain-computer-interface would take body movements out of the process. Less required skill and more information flow density are only the most obvious benefits. It is a potential replacement for dozens of today&#x27;s specialized devices. And, just as a microphone does for voice, it would also allow the transfer of visual imaginations.\r\n\r\nBefore we explain how to create the most advanced brain-computer-interface possible today, Dominic dives quite deeply into the signal processing structure in the brain. He presents the most recent findings in cognitive science and explains what happens - step for step - when we imagine the image of a red ball. At the end of this first section, he arrives at the level of electrical signals.\r\n\r\nAnne then takes over with the groundwork necessary to capture and process these electrical signals. She isn&#x27;t afraid to use proper math for a deeper understanding, but she made sure that her talk is easy to follow for non-tech majors too. The foundation for a contemporary brain-computer-interface consists of several core algorithms, which are used in lab settings today and by enthusiasts tomorrow. She calls out the pitfalls when dealing with signals from live brains, and covers the technical limitations with crunching the data.\r\n\r\nWe finish with a real-world perspective. The power of today&#x27;s available hardware and software is still limited, but our understanding of informations inside and outside the brain has improved drastically. We&#x27;ve come a long way since electrode-level pattern matching, and we&#x27;d be excited to show you some examples of what&#x27;s possible today.&quot;",

                        "abstract": "&quot;We developed a modified Xen hypervisor, that is able to clone a virtual machine running on that hypervisor when an attack on that machine is detected. The clone is then on-the-fly transformed into a honeypot and the attackers traffic is then transparently redirected to that clone. Once the attack is over or a time limit is exceeded, the clone is stopped and modifications the attacker has made are reported.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;Honeypots are special servers that should attract attackers and divert their attention from real systems. There are two ways how to run such honeypots.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Low interactive honeypots simulate a special server or service, but don&#x27;t allow an attacker to actually break into the service and do something with it. They are usually very fast to install, but don&#x27;t provide that much information about an attacker.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;High interactive honeypots allow an attacker to break into the honeypot and run real voundable software. However, they need a lot of maintenance and they must be updated regularly to match the configuration of the real servers they should protect.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\nWe developed a patch to the Xen hypervisor, so that honeypots are created on demand, using a real system as a basis. Our approach works as follows:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;First, any kind of IDS system needs to detect an attack. You can use any system you like, network and host-based, as long as the system can provide the attackers source ip address.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Once an attack is detected, the guest VM is cloned. The cloning procedure is a modified Xen live migration procedure, but the original VM is not stopped.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The storage of the VM is cloned too, using a LVM snapshot.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The RAM of the clone is examined and sensitive data is replaced with dummy data. For example the root password hash is replaced and private RSA keys can be removed.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Blocks in the LVM storage that contain sensitive information like private RSA keys are blocked on an hypersivor-level using the device-mapper error target. Access to these blocks from the clone will result in I/O errors.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Additional processes, called honey-tokens, that will attract the attention of the attacker can be injected into the clone. For example a process named &lt;i&gt;backup-sync&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;password-verify-daemon&lt;/li&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;key-access&lt;/i&gt; can be started.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Also, additional accounts can be injected with weak passwords.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Shell-command like find and grep can be replaced with special versions. If an attacker is looking for something, he will find it on that system.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Finally, network-traffic from the attacker is isolated and redirected to the clone. In addition, outgoing traffic from the clone to other systems can be restricted. If the attacker already had a shell like ssh or telnet on the system when the attack was detected, the corresponding TCP connection will survive that procedure and the redirection will be absolutely transparent to the attacker.&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\nOnce the attack is over, the memory image and the changes to the block device can be examined using standard forensic tools. &quot;",

                        "abstract": "&quot; \tIncreasingly, users and their computing hardware are exposed a range of software and hardware attacks, ranging from disk imaging to hardware keylogger installation and beyond. Existing methods are inadequate to fully protect users, particularly from covert physical hardware modifications in the 'evil maid' scenario, and yet are very inconvenient. Victims include governments and corporations traveling internationally (e.g. China), anti-government activists in places like Syria, and anyone who is a target of a motivated attacker who can gain physical access.\r\n\r\nPhysically Unclonable Functions, combined with a trusted mobile device and a network service, can be used to mitigate these risks. We present a novel open-source mobile client and network service which can protect arbitrary hardware from many forms of covert modification and attack, and which when integrated with software, firmware, and policy defenses, can provide greater protection to users and limit potential attack surface.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;Additional Notes for our talk:\r\n\r\n1) The attack addressed is an entire class of hardware, firmware, and software attacks around the attacker gaining surreptitious access and modification (of hardware/firmware/software) on one or more occasions, followed by the authorized user making normal use of the device after these modifications.\r\n\r\nA software-only attack can be addressed through 'trusted boot' or 'measured boot' systems (e.g. what TCG does). Firmware attacks are generally not addressed by most measured boot processes, but that&#x27;s just an implementation problem. The most novel category of attack is defeating the addition of hardware components or modification of hardware components, which becomes a desirable attack once software/firmware are locked down.\r\n\r\nOne scenario is that an investor flies to China with a laptop and a cellphone and intends to remain in the country for several weeks, conducting business online as well as in person. On several occasions, the investor leaves his laptop in his hotel room, while taking his cellphone with him at all times. Adversary agents, as hotel staff, enter the room and make modifications to hardware, with the intent of circumventing either local software protections (cloning drives, capturing pass phrases, etc.) or subverting network resources later accessed, either while the investor remains in China or after he returns to the home office with the laptop.\r\n\r\nIn-depth physical analysis of the hardware, conducted at home base, can often discover hardware modifications. Best current practice is to quarantine 'travel' machines and never allow them back on high security networks. Unfortunately, this leaves the user exposed for the entire duration of a single trip -- in some situations the entire transaction happens during a trip, so all sensitive information must be protected for that trip.\r\n\r\nPUFs and our network verification can be used to effectively 'sign' hardware in the field in a way which can be automatically verified and verified interactively with a 'home base' network service. This lets network resources be protected continuously; before every access, the client device&#x27;s integrity can be checked and attested.\r\n\r\nAn interesting strategy is to not travel with any sensitive hardware (beyond the cellphone) and buy random laptops at the destination, enroll them in the service while at the destination, provision them with services, and ensure no subsequent unauthorized hardware/firmware/software changes can be made, using the same system.\r\n\r\n2) PUFs\r\n\r\nThe PUFs are functions which can&#x27;t be (tractably) cloned. Unfortunately, virtually none of these can be inspected/verified/attested directly by an unaided human -- anything which is a simple serial number seal or other human-verifiable thing can be fairly trivially counterfeited.\r\n\r\nThe PUFs make use of large amounts of random and changing data, created through physically random processes which are impossible to (tractably) reproduce. The innovation is to use a user&#x27;s cellphone and a network service as the verifier -- the phone can remain in the user&#x27;s physical custody at all times, and by splitting the verification between the phone (on site with the user) and a network service acting as gatekeeper to protected network resources, the system can be protected from various attacks.\r\n\r\nThe PUFS that we take advatage of are that of the physical systems themselves. When a device is created during manufacture a multitude of processes are utilized to produce the compute device. As it turns out reproducibility on the sub millimetre scale of a identical compenents such as a laptop case is excessively difficult to clone/counterfit/interact with without disturbing the previous state. We take advantage of these flaws to aid the user in detecting modification to their computing devices through photography and other standard low cost tamper evidencing devices which a untrained user can deploy in the field.\r\n\r\nClear technical documentation w/ photos explaining why it is incredibly difficult with current attack methods to perfectly clone manufactured parts which on the surface are indistinguishable from another manufactured assembly.&quot;",

This evidence includes increasing use of targeted attacks to establish even more invasive control over corporate, government or other so-called legitimate targets.\r\n\r\nEverything transiting our network connections is under surveillance to some degree. It&#x27;s also common for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to use exploits and malware to infect and monitor computers, mobile devices and to spy on networks. They&#x27;re able to bug our rooms with our own telephones, read encrypted emails, log keystrokes - they invade the most personal spaces in the very core of a person&#x27;s life with minimal economic impact to their budget.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we&#x27;ll discuss the nature of targeted and untargeted surveillance, exploitation and intelligence gathering. This active surveillance is produced and operated not only by governments but by corporations and mercenaries that provide their intrusion services to the highest bidders who often have the lowest respect for human rights.\r\n\r\nWe&#x27;ll introduce you to the players in the business of active, passive, tactical and strategic surveillance and the products they provide. We&#x27;ll also discuss examples of specific attacks on journalists and human rights activists worldwide in the last couple of years. Surprises won&#x27;t be missing.&quot;",

On this day, The Indian Parliament passed the 'The Information Technology (Amendment) Act' with no debate in the House, which effectively means is that the government of India now has the power to monitor all digital communications in the country without a court order or a warrant. The 'world&#x27;s largest democracy' strongly leaning towards becoming a surveillance state raises many questions and poses severe challenges for free speech and economic justice in India and globally. This talk will map and review the current political, socio-cultural and legal landscape of mass-surveillance, data protection and censorship in India and analyse how it ties in to the global landscape of surveillance and censorship. It will also aim to create a discussion space to investigate the deeper effects of these so called 'welfare' projects and how citizen-led movements can drive the state towards stronger data protection and privacy laws.&quot;",

These include the world’s largest biometric ID scheme (Aadhaar/UID), the Central Monitoring System(CMS), the Telephone Call Interception System (TCIS), a DNA data bank and the  National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID).\r\n\r\nThe  'world&#x27;s largest democracy' strongly leaning towards becoming a surveillance state raises many questions and poses severe challenges for free speech and economic justice, not just in India but globally.\r\n\r\nThis talk will map and review the current political, socio-cultural and legal landscape of mass-surveillance, data protection and censorship in India and analyse how it ties in to the global landscape of surveillance and censorship.

Program what you will into a robot: emotional response, basic problem solving, artificial intelligence whatever- how can anyone program divergent thinking? seriously?\r\nSo, when the robots take over because they are more efficient and immortal- the only thing we’ll be able to leverage against them will be our creativity. Therefore:\r\nSalvation = Creativity\r\n\r\nHow far will one allow a machine to intrude on the body?\r\n\r\nThe human brain is also distinctive from animals because of how highly we can value an idea. For instance, sharks will never go on hunger strikes.....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtists are more important than consumers.\r\nWhen you go from consuming to producing. It is a big step. You are the makers, contributing, not just consuming, as long as we are doing that we are helping. It is a leap in your lifes role.\r\nWhen you stop worrying what movies are showing and are worried to spend time in your studio you know you are onto something. You are in a dialogue with the planet. you view the world different.\r\n\r\nHow do we do it? How to keep making art?\r\nIf we pay to do our art, this is no different than doing volunteerism.  Which is proven to be the most rewarding thing you can do with your life. To give something away.\r\nArtists create their own reward system....\r\nwe must create our own mutual aid societies\r\n\r\nWe must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances\r\n\r\n-You have to go out and look for counter culture, it is not necessarily in mainstream press, tv or radio.\r\n-Be at peace not having a day job, it is ok, you don&#x27;t need insurance or 'security' part of becoming an artist is to be free, not a slave.\r\n-A half full glass is just fine\r\n-Decide your hobby is your career.\r\n-Ignore the fact that you lack the skills in either art or marketing to support yourself as an artist. Make a lot of art, \r\n\r\nbut if you’re looking for affirmation from outside the tribe, forget about it because most of those people couldn’t give a crap about you, unless there’s money involved.\r\n\r\nArt is about life. The market is about money.&quot;",

This talk will outline a framework for a user-focused approach to the Development and Impact of Internet Freedom Tools through using ethnography, human-centered design, and the practice of research-based product definition. This talk is intended for developers, researchers, and journalists who seek to understand how better tools can be developed to protect anonymity and provide unfettered access to the Internet.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;Internet Freedom Tools (IFTs) are developed to solve the technical challenges of anonymity, privacy, security and information access. Focus on these technical challenges rather than the user of an IFT can lead to overlooking the motivations, needs and usability issues faced by user communities. Further, IFTs may solve a technical challenge for users, and yet fall short when it comes to user experience. There is a disconnect that must be remedied for IFTs and the people who use them to realize their full potential. This talk seeks to provide new insights to developers and users in need of knowledge on how they can better address relevant problems, create appropriate solutions and help users with IFTs.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explain to the audience what tools are available for user-focused design. It will also walk through a framework to guide the development of IFTs that is grounded in ethnographic methods and human-centered design, and how this framework is being used to conduct an IFT user community.\r\n\r\nThis work is currently being conducted by SecondMuse and Radio Free Asia through the Open Technology Fund (www.opentechfund.org).\r\n\r\nADDENDUM: But, what is 'Ethnography'? What are 'User Communities'?\r\n\r\nEthnography is defined as the study of culture and human motivation through qualitative research. Ethnographic practices complement usability studies by tapping into needs and motivations of people and users to give the 'why' behind certain actions observed solely through conducting usability research. This method includes interviews, observing specific behaviors and understanding the material culture and surrounds of a target group. \r\n\r\nA community is defined as a group of users that can be defined by geography, culture, shared experiences, or shared challenges. User is defined as someone who is currently utilizing a particular IFTs such as Tor, RedPhone, CryptoCat, and/or other privacy, security, anonymity and access enhancing technologies and methodologies created by developers or users themselves. A user may also be defined as a potential user of such technologies and tools.&quot;",

The first part of our talk deals with security issues of HomeMatic devices and their wireless communication protocol called BidCoS (Bidirectional Communication Standard). In the second part we introduce Homegear, our own interface software to control HomeMatic devices.&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;In the past few years wireless home automation systems have become increasingly available as a good alternative to wired systems. Since wireless devices are installable without ripping open walls, it is now possible to easily integrate them into an existing building infrastructure. We chose to work with HomeMatic, because we think that through its affordable prices, its good quality and its fast growing portfolio it will become the most widely spread wireless home automation system in Germany.\r\nIn this live hacking presentation we will introduce different mechanisms to attack a HomeMatic system. We will show how to sniff BidCoS packets, how to send arbitrary packets in order to emulate a device (e. g. a HomeMatic central) and to control devices.\r\nSome devices use an AES handshake to verify the sender of a command. But not all devices support the handshake and for many devices it is disabled by default. We will demonstrate several attacks making use of this security issue.\r\nAfter the live hacking part we will give a short introduction into Homegear. Homegear is an interface software, which directly communicates with BidCoS devices and is controllable through XML RPC (XML Remote Procedure Call). It is possible to fully control most HomeMatic devices. We developed it to add features which are not integrated into the official system like controlling valve drives directly to implement custom room temperature control algorithms.&quot;",

I will focus on the vertebral setup with bone and connective tissues. How are they build and what their function is. \r\nI will also present some worst case scenarios of consequences when slipped discs cut of nerves and numbness in arms or legs are mild problems you might encounter.\r\nSmall changes in posture and daily habits will be presented, because you have to know why and how you should do it.&quot;",

Are instrumentality and domination inherent to the essence of technology? Can hacking provide an alternative approach to technology which can overcome this? How do art and beauty fit into this approach?&quot;",
                        "description": "&quot;In order to understand the essence of hacking, it is important to first critically examine the essence of (modern) technology and the rationalization of technological development.\r\nBecause for all the wonderful things technology has given us, it has also brought us a vast array of instruments for domination, ranging from nuclear warheads to the panoptic surveillance state. As a community that is so deeply involved with technology, it is imperative for us to comprehend that these developments did not come out of thin air and that we have the choice to follow a different path.\r\nUnderstanding Heideggers notion of enframing as the product of historical rationalization gives us an insight in the relation between the objective, scientific approach to technology and its instrumentalization as a means for domination.\r\nYet it also highlights the subversive potential of hacker cultures. The hackers&#x27; playful curiosity and desire to express creativity within the computer-imposed frameworks of formal logic has the potential to transcend code into poetry, reconnecting techne with poiesis and mapping the road towards the revealing nature of technology. Hacking has the potential to elevate abstract technological mechanisms and relations dissociated from the individuality to the plane of the utmost concrete and subjective images. As the creative output of the hacker both adheres to the formal methods of boolean logic and at the same time challenges them by devoiding them of their rational finalities, the positivist rationale of what we hold to be most objective can be turned into an expression of the subject. I will argue that this repositioning of the subject provides the basis for transforming the technological rationale into one that is aimed at liberation.\r\n&quot;",

In den U.S.A. ist es 2010 gelungen, ein umstrittenes Gesetz umzusetzen, das die Finanzierung von Kriegsparteien durch Erzhandel regulieren soll. In der EU soll nun ähnliches geschehen.

                        "description": "&quot;'Dead Tree Edition' wird auf ironische Weise Ausgedrucktes genannt, das auch elektronisch verfügbar ist. Man ignoriert dabei, dass für die Online-Infrastruktur und all die Computer nicht nur Bäume, sondern gleich ganze Berge, auf denen sie gestanden haben, abgetragen werden. Und Menschen kommen auch zu Schaden.\r\n\r\nUm die Jahrtausendwende hat die UN aufgedeckt, dass der Handel mit Metallerzen, wie sie zur Herstellung von Elektronikbauteilen benutzt werden, die Konfliktparteien in der D.R. Kongo finanziert und somit den Bürgerkrieg am Leben erhält. Der Begriff der 'Konfliktmineralien' wurde geboren. \r\n\r\nZehn Jahre später hat ein engagiertes Bündnis von Nichtregierungsorganisationen eine Regelung in ein US-amerikanisches Börsengesetz (Dodd-Frank-Act) einbringen können, das die Hersteller verpflichtet, den Kauf gewisser Rohstoffe aus dem Kongo zu veröffentlichen. Die Folgen waren zunächst verheerend, später zukunftsweisend. Konfliktfreie Mineralien aus dem Gebiet sind nun dank einiger Hersteller erhältlich, Kondensatoren werden daraus hergestellt, Lötzinn produziert, das FairPhone macht daraus ein Produkt, Intel bis Jahresende einen Prozessor.\r\n\r\nNun will die EU nachziehen und ebenfalls zur Transparenz beim Kauf von Rohstoffen aus Konflikt- und Risikogebieten verpflichten. Das könnte große Wirkung auf unsere Elektronikprodukte haben. Wir sollten Einfluss auf die Ausformulierung nehmen, es droht nämlich eine nur freiwillige, sanktionsfreie, nicht weitgehende Regelung, im Sinne der Industrie. \r\n\r\nWas wir aber brauchen, ist eine Regelung, die den Minenarbeitern wirksam hilft. Nur mit einer starken Gesetzgebung kann es uns gelingen, die Produktion von IT fairer zu gestalten.\r\n&quot;",
